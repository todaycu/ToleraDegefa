							 ## Greetings! I am Tolera Degefa, a passionate self-taught software developer with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I am thrilled to welcome you to my website, where I invite you to join me on an exciting journey of innovation and learning.

							 As an ardent problem-solver and advocate of digital security, I channel my expertise into crafting elegant solutions that address complex challenges. Through my relentless pursuit of knowledge, I have delved deep into the fascinating realm of security research, constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. In my quest for growth, I eagerly take on Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, sharpening my skills and expanding my horizons.

							 Beyond coding, I am an avid reader, with a voracious appetite for technology-related articles. I immerse myself in the latest developments, particularly focusing on Linux, Python, and React. By staying informed and up to date, I ensure that I am equipped with the latest tools and techniques to deliver top-notch solutions.

							 Join me on this extraordinary journey as we collaborate to build something remarkable and acquire new knowledge along the way. Together, let's create a world where innovation thrives and boundaries are shattered.

							 Thank you for visiting my GitHub, and I look forward to embarking on this exciting adventure with you.miasBahru&style=flat-square&color=blue" alt="profi
